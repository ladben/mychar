      <p>Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals <b>1d8 extra damage</b> when you hit a creature within 10 feet of you. This damage is <b>radiant, necrotic, or cold</b> <i>(your choice when you cast the spell)</i>. Any creature that takes this damage <b>can't regain hit points</b> until the start of your next turn.</p>
      <p>In addition, <b>any creature of your choice</b> that you can see that starts its turn within 10 feet of you has its <b>speed reduced by 10 feet</b> until the start of your next turn.</p>

      <p>You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors. A <b>20-foot-radius sphere</b> of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered on a point within range and lasting for the duration. This void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 30 feet away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded.</p>
      <p>The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is <b>difficult terrain</b>. Any creature that <b>starts its turn</b> in the area takes <b>2d6 cold damage</b>. Any creature that <b>ends its turn</b> in the area must succeed on a <b>Dexterity saving throw</b> or take <b>2d6 acid damage</b> as milky, otherworldly tentacles rub against it.</p>
